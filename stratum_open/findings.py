"""A finding: one problem on one spot of a PR, from the model or from a check.

Every finding gets a fingerprint from what it's about (its rule, file and the
code on its lines), not from where it sits, so the same problem keeps the same
fingerprint when lines move. Inline comments, resolved threads, `@stratum
ignore` and 👍/👎 feedback all key on it.
