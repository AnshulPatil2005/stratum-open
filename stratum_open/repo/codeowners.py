"""CODEOWNERS: who owns each changed file, read the way GitHub reads it.

- GitHub uses the first CODEOWNERS it finds in `.github/`, the root, then
  `docs/`.
- In it, the last line that matches a path wins, and a pattern with no owners
  takes ownership away again.
- Patterns follow .gitignore's rules:
  - one with a slash at its start or in its middle is anchored to the root;
  - a trailing slash means a folder;
  - `*` stays inside one folder and `**` crosses them;
  - a match on a folder covers everything inside it, except that `dir/*`
    covers only the files directly in `dir`.
