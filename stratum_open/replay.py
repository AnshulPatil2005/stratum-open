"""`stratum-open replay owner/repo`: what the checks and triage would have
said on a repo's closed PRs, beside what became of each one.

It only reads. A maintainer sees the labels their own last PRs would have
got before installing anything, and the rows are the data for measuring
triage against what maintainers did: merged, or closed without merging.

Each PR is judged as it was at its last push, as far as GitHub still knows:

- the diff, the paths, the size and the files the checks read in full are
  those of the PR's final commit;
- CI is that commit's check runs and statuses as they stood when the PR was
  closed (`GitHub.ci_state_at`), without Stratum's own;
- linked issues are the closing keywords in the PR's description.

What can't be rebuilt afterwards is left out, never guessed, and the report
says so (`notes`): the model's review, the author's track record, the labels
the PR had then, what a package registry said that day. A track record as of
a day could be built from a clone (`build_records` takes a `ref` and a `now`),
but a replay has no clone, and it would take a walk of the history per PR and
today's commit emails to match the login.

Requests: two for the run (the repo, its policy) and one per 100 PRs listed;
then per PR one for the diff, two for CI, and one per file the checks read in
full (workflows, manifests, Python files).
