"""What a review needs from the code host: the seam between the review and
GitHub, GitLab or anything else.

`runner.review_pull` and `github.publish` call these methods on
`Context.gh`, and nothing else. `github.api.GitHub` is the reference
implementation, and the shapes below are GitHub's: another host's client
(`gitlab.api.GitLab`) answers in the same shapes, so the review, the summary,
the inline comments and the triage code are shared as they are. A client
raises `GitHubError` (or a subclass) when the host refuses a call; the runner
catches that one type.

The shapes, as the runner and `publish` read them:

- `pull(number)`: {"number", "state": "open" | ..., "draft", "title", "body",
  "user": {"login", "type"} | None, "head": {"sha", "ref"}, "labels":
  [{"name"}], "additions", "deletions"}.
- `issue_comments(number)`: oldest first, [{"id", "body", "user": {"login"}}].
- `review_threads(number)`: [{"id", "resolved", "path", "comments": [{"id",
  "body", "author"}]}], the first comment being the one that opened the thread.
- `create_review(number, head_sha, comments)`: each comment is {"path",
  "line", "side": "RIGHT", "body"} plus "start_line" for a range, in new-file
  line numbers; a comment the host won't place is a `GitHubError` with
  status 422, and the caller then posts the comments one at a time.
- `check_run(...)`: the review's verdict on the head commit (a check run on
  GitHub, a commit status on GitLab). `review.early_checks` starts it first
  with `start_check_run`, and `stop_early` reads it back with
  `check_run_output`.

`SURFACE` lists the names, and a test keeps it in step with what the runner
and `publish` call, so a new call there shows up as one every host's client
has to answer.
