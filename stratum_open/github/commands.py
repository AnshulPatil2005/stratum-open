"""`/stratum` commands in PR comments.

A command starts a line: `/stratum review`. `@stratum` isn't one: GitHub links it
to an unrelated organization of that name.

Anyone can ask for help, the PR's triage or their own track record. An
explanation or an answer to a question calls the model, so on a public repo it
would let anyone make the maintainers' model server work: it's for the PR's
author and people with write access, a few a day between the two. Changing
what Stratum reports (re-review, ignore, mute) takes write access.
