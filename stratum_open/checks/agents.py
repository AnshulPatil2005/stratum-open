"""Text aimed at the AI tools that read a repo rather than at people: changes
to the files that steer coding agents, and characters a reviewer can't see.

Both are ways to get instructions past a human reviewer. An agent file says
what an assistant should do whenever it works in this repo; invisible
characters can hide such instructions (or reorder code, "Trojan Source")
inside a line that looks harmless.
