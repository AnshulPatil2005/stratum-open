"""Dependencies a PR adds, and whether each one is the package it seems to be.

A dependency is new when its name is on an added line of a manifest, and on
no removed line of any manifest of the same ecosystem nor on another line of
the same file. So bumping a version, or moving a package between sections or
files, doesn't count. Packages from a local path or a workspace aren't
third-party and aren't reported; ones from git or a URL are, but get no
registry or look-alike checks. Go's `// indirect` requirements are left out:
they come with another module.

Manifests are read line by line, so a line's section is known only when the
diff (or the file's full content, from `contents`) shows the section's
header. Without the header a line counts only if it looks unmistakably like
a dependency:

- `package.json`: a `"name": "^1.2.3"`-style line (a version range, a tag
  like `latest`, or `npm:`/`git+`/`github:` and the like) whose key isn't a
  known top-level field. A `devDependencies` entry and a `resolutions` entry
  look the same, so the second can be taken for a dependency.
- `pyproject.toml`: a quoted requirement with a version, extras or marker,
  such as `"httpx>=0.27"`. A bare `"httpx"` isn't told apart from a keyword.
  Poetry tables are read only when their header is shown.
- `Cargo.toml`: `name = "1.2"` or `name = { version = ... }`.
- `go.mod`: a module path and version.

With `dependencies.known_vulnerabilities` on, every dependency an added line
sets to one exact version, new or bumped, is also looked up in the OSV
database (osv.dev), and gets a finding when that version has published
advisories. Exact means `name==1.2.3` in a requirements file or
pyproject.toml, a bare `1.2.3` in a Poetry table or package.json, `=1.2.3`
in Cargo.toml (a bare version there is a range) and a go.mod requirement. A
range has no single answer, so it gets no finding. The finding's severity is
the highest OSV labels any of the advisories with; when it labels none, the
finding is medium.

The only thing sent to a registry is a dependency's name. OSV is sent the
name, the ecosystem and the version.
