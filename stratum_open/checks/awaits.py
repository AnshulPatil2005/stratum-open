"""A coroutine called without `await` in Python.

`f()` inside an `async def`, where `f` is a coroutine, makes a coroutine
object and runs nothing: no error, just a "never awaited" warning if anyone is
looking. Without types we can't know `f` is a coroutine, but the file says so
when the same call is awaited elsewhere in it, or when the PR's removed lines
awaited it. So a call is flagged when:

- it's on an added line inside an `async def` (not inside a nested `def` or
  `lambda`),
- the same callee (`self._fin.close`, `ensure_awaitable`) is awaited
  somewhere in the file, or on a line the PR removed,
- and its value isn't awaited, passed to another call (`create_task(f())`,
  `gather(f())`), entered by `async with`, yielded, or put in a name that is
  awaited later or handed to an awaited call (`await wait_for(coro, 5)`).

With the file's full text the code is parsed; without it only single lines are
read, so less is caught.
